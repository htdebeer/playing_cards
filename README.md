Playing cards
=============

Playing cards (`playing_cards`) is a JavaScript library for creating card
games. 

## Roadmap

The `playing_cards` project is just a couple of weeks old and still under
heavy development. I plan on building the following features:

- version 0.1: you can create any patience game with `playing_cards`
- version 0.2: you can also create multi player games with `playing_cards`

After finishing version 0.1 I intend to first create a number of patience
games with `playing_cards` to improve the library.
